## Quick Start

Under two minutes from install to first response.

| Platform / tool | Install |
|:---|:---|
| macOS, Linux | `curl -fsSL https://get.ferrolabs.ai \| sh` |
| Windows | `irm https://get.ferrolabs.ai/install.ps1 \| iex` |
| Homebrew | `brew install ferro-labs/tap/ferrogw` |
| Scoop | `scoop bucket add ferrolabs https://github.com/ferro-labs/homebrew-tap` then `scoop install ferrogw` |
| npm | `npm install -g ferrogw` |
| Python | `uv tool install ferrogw` |
| Docker | `docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/ferro-labs/ai-gateway:latest` |
| Go | `go install github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway/cmd/ferrogw@latest` — builds from source, without the dashboard |
| Debian, RPM, Alpine | `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.apk` packages on the [releases page](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway/releases/latest) |

Then go from nothing to a served request:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key     # ferrogw init detects this and writes the matching target
ferrogw init                          # writes config.yaml, prints your master key
export GATEWAY_CONFIG=./config.yaml   # the server reads a config file only when this is set
export MASTER_KEY=fgw_your-master-key # the key ferrogw init printed
ferrogw serve                         # starts the server on :8080
```

`ferrogw init` prints the master key **once** and never writes it to disk — save
it yourself, in your `.env` file or a secret manager.

Docker runs the server itself, so there is no `ferrogw init` to print a master
key — choose your own. Pass both variables by name so their values stay off the
command line, where `ps` would show them:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
export MASTER_KEY=fgw-any-strong-secret-you-choose
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY -e MASTER_KEY ghcr.io/ferro-labs/ai-gateway:latest
```

Passing them by name keeps the values out of process arguments only — they are
still readable in the container's environment and through `docker inspect`, so
use Docker secrets or your platform's secret storage in production.

  <img src="docs/demo.gif" alt="Installing Ferro Labs AI Gateway with one command, running ferrogw init, starting the server, and getting a completed chat response" width="100%" />
</div>

### First request

```bash
export MASTER_KEY=fgw_your-master-key   # the key ferrogw init printed, in whichever shell you curl from

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASTER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Ferro Labs AI Gateway"}]
  }' | jq
```

Every release is signed with keyless cosign and ships an SPDX SBOM —
verification steps are in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#verifying-releases).

## Why Ferro Labs AI Gateway

AI gateways differ most under load, in throughput, latency and memory. Ferro Labs AI Gateway is written in Go from the ground up for real-world throughput — a single binary that routes LLM requests with predictable latency and minimal resource usage.

## Features

| Capability | What it does | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🔀 **Routing** | 8 strategies — single, fallback, load balance, least latency, cost-optimized, content-based, A/B test, conditional — with per-target retry, failover, and model aliases | [Docs →](https://docs.ferrolabs.ai/routing/) |
| 🔌 **30 providers** | Chat and streaming everywhere; embeddings, images, rerank, moderations, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and batch where the vendor offers them | [Docs →](https://docs.ferrolabs.ai/providers/) |
| 🛡️ **Guardrails & plugins** | Eleven built in — word filter, regex guard, PII redaction, secret scanning, prompt-injection shield, response schema validation, token/message limits, response cache, rate limiting, per-key budgets, request logging — and the plugin framework is public for writing your own | [Docs →](https://docs.ferrolabs.ai/plugins/) |
| 🎯 **Capability matrix** | One declarative record of which OpenAI parameters each provider forwards, translates, or cannot express, served by `GET /v1/capabilities` | [Docs →](https://docs.ferrolabs.ai/guides/provider-capabilities/) |
| 🤖 **MCP** | Connects to stdio and Streamable HTTP tool servers, injects their tools into chat completions, and drives the agentic `tool_calls` loop itself | [Docs →](https://docs.ferrolabs.ai/guides/mcp/) |
| 📊 **Observability** | OpenTelemetry tracing and Prometheus metrics, one trace ID across logs and spans — a zero-allocation no-op until enabled | [Docs →](https://docs.ferrolabs.ai/guides/observability/) |
| 🖥️ **Dashboard** | Operations console compiled into the binary and served at `/` — traffic, spend, provider health, request logs, audit trail | [Docs →](https://docs.ferrolabs.ai/guides/dashboard/) |

---

## Dashboard

Every release binary serves a built-in operations console at `/` — same port as
the API, compiled in with `go:embed`, no second image and no second origin. Sign
in with your `MASTER_KEY` or any admin / read-only key and it reads the live
gateway: traffic, spend, provider health, routing, plugins, request logs, and the
audit trail.

The bundle is produced by the release pipeline, so a binary built with
`go install` is the one exception: it answers `/` with a placeholder instead.
Any other install method above ships the console.

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/dashboard.gif" alt="Ferro Labs AI Gateway operations console: Overview, Analytics, Providers, Routing Strategies, Plugins, Playground, Tracing, Request Logs, Audit Trail, Configuration, and API Keys" width="100%" />
</div>

Overview, Analytics (latency/TTFT/cost percentiles), Providers, Routing,
Plugins, a Playground over the real routing path, Tracing, Request Logs, the
Audit Trail, Configuration with history/rollback, and scoped API key management.

Run the gateway and open <http://localhost:8080>. To see it filled like the
recording above, bring up the self-contained demo stack:

```bash
make up-fullstack   # gateway + Postgres + Jaeger + Prometheus + Grafana + mock upstream + load generator
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Examples

Integration examples for common use cases are in [ferro-labs/ai-gateway-examples](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway-examples):

| Example | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| [basic](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway-examples/tree/main/basic) | Single chat completion to the first configured provider |
| [fallback](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway-examples/tree/main/fallback) | Fallback strategy — try providers in order with retries |

---

## Configuration

One YAML/JSON file, named by `GATEWAY_CONFIG`, drives routing, guardrails, MCP
tools, and observability:

```yaml
strategy:
  mode: fallback              # 8 modes — see internal/strategies/README.md

targets:
  - virtual_key: openai       # an allowlist: only listed providers are routable
    retry: { attempts: 3 }    # per target, honoured under every routing mode
    concurrency: { max_concurrency: 32, queue_size: 1000 }
  - virtual_key: anthropic

aliases:
  fast: gpt-4o-mini

plugins:                      # guardrails first, then cache — see plugin/README.md
  - name: word-filter
    type: guardrail
    stage: before_request
    enabled: true
    config: { blocked_words: ["password", "secret"] }

mcp_servers:                  # tool servers — see mcp/README.md
  - name: search
    url: https://mcp.example.com/mcp
    headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ${SEARCH_TOKEN}" }
```

`${VAR}` references (braced form only) resolve when a component is constructed,
never at file load — so secrets are never stored, served by `GET /admin/config`,
or restored by a rollback. A bare `$` is data; an undefined variable is an
error.

The full annotated reference with every option is
[config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) /
[config.example.json](config.example.json), and the schema guide is
[config/README.md](config/README.md). `ferrogw validate` checks a file without
starting the server.

### Key environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `MASTER_KEY` | Bootstrap and break-glass admin credential (generated by `ferrogw init`); give each operator their own key from `POST /admin/keys` for day-to-day use |
| `GATEWAY_CONFIG` | Path to config YAML/JSON |
| `GATEWAY_ENV` | Set to `production` to enable production-mode safety guards: it refuses to start on `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_PROXY=true` or a `*` entry in `CORS_ORIGINS`, and warns when per-IP rate limiting is off, pprof is mounted, or the API key store is in-memory |
| `PORT` | Server port (default: `8080`) |
| `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_PROXY` | Set to `true` to disable proxy-route auth (dev only; blocked when `GATEWAY_ENV=production`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins; cross-origin is denied when unset. Matched **literally** — there is no wildcard, so list each origin explicitly |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | CIDRs of trusted reverse proxies; forwarded headers are honored only from these (default: loopback). See [config/README.md](config/README.md#trusted-proxies-trusted_proxies) |
| `<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL` | Points a provider at a proxy, self-hosted server, or regional endpoint. It is the **API root**, used verbatim — write it exactly as the vendor documents it, version segment included (`https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`); a bare host resolves to the provider's own version segment |

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full environment variable reference including provider API keys, store backends, and OTel settings.

---

## Observability

**See everything your gateway does** — every request, what it cost, how long it took, which provider served it, and which guardrails ran. Ferro Labs AI Gateway ships first-class **OpenTelemetry tracing** and **Prometheus metrics** out of the box, and stays at a **zero-allocation no-op until you turn it on**. Point it at **Jaeger, Grafana, New Relic, LangSmith, Datadog, or Honeycomb** — anything that speaks OTLP — and every request emits a `gateway.request` span carrying GenAI semantic conventions (`gen_ai.*`) plus `ferro.*` extensions for cost, routing, MCP tool calls, and stream timings. The same trace ID threads your logs, spans, and the `X-Request-ID` response header. Requests can name the end user and session they belong to (`user`, `X-User-ID`, `X-Session-ID`, or W3C baggage), and that identity rides the request span, every event, and request-log rows.

> 📈 **Full observability guide → [observability/README.md](observability/README.md)** — managed-backend setup, endpoint & transport rules, every emitted attribute, privacy levels, and exporter plugins.

Bring up the gateway wired to a full monitoring stack — **Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger** — driven by generated traffic, in one command:

```bash
make up-fullstack   # then open Grafana at http://localhost:3000
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/observability/grafana-dashboard.gif" alt="Grafana dashboard: per-provider request rate, latency percentiles, token cost, and circuit-breaker state" width="100%" />
  <br/>
  <em>Grafana — request rate, latency percentiles, per-provider breakdown, token cost, and circuit-breaker state, all from the gateway's Prometheus metrics.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/observability/jaeger-trace.gif" alt="Jaeger trace: one gateway.request span expanding to show its gen_ai.* and ferro.* attributes" width="100%" />
  <br/>
  <em>Jaeger — one request's <code>gateway.request</code> span, opened to reveal its <code>gen_ai.*</code> and <code>ferro.*</code> attributes.</em>
</p>

Enable tracing with one variable (or the `observability:` config block —
endpoint, protocol, sampling, privacy, headers are all documented in the guide):

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
ferrogw serve
```

---

## CLI

`ferrogw` is a single binary — no separate CLI tool required.

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `ferrogw` | Start the gateway server (default) |
| `ferrogw serve` | Start the gateway server (explicit) |
| `ferrogw init` | First-run setup — generate master key and config |
| `ferrogw validate` | Validate a config file without starting |
| `ferrogw doctor` | Check environment (API keys, config, connectivity) |
| `ferrogw status` | Show gateway health and provider status |
| `ferrogw version` | Print version, commit, and build info |
| `ferrogw admin keys list` | List API keys |
| `ferrogw admin keys create --name <name>` | Create an API key (`--scope`, `--expires-in`) |
| `ferrogw admin logs stats` | Show request log statistics |
| `ferrogw plugins` | List registered plugins |

Global flags available on all subcommands: `--gateway-url`, `--api-key`, `--format` (table/json/yaml).

---

## Deployment

### Local development

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
export MASTER_KEY=fgw_your-master-key
export GATEWAY_CONFIG=./config.yaml
make build && ./bin/ferrogw
```

### Railway & Render

The deploy buttons at the top of this README provision either platform: Railway
with SQLite on a volume (point `API_KEY_STORE_DSN`, `CONFIG_STORE_DSN` and
`REQUEST_LOG_STORE_DSN` at paths under `/data`) or PostgreSQL, and Render from the repo's `render.yaml` Blueprint,
which generates `MASTER_KEY` and wires the store DSNs to a managed Postgres
automatically.

### Docker Compose

Three Compose files in `deploy/` follow the standard override pattern — a shared
base, a dev override that builds from source, and a prod override with a pinned
tag, health check, and resource limits. Run everything from the repository root:

```bash
make up             # dev: builds from source
IMAGE_TAG=v1.4.5 CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com make up-prod
make down           # tears down either
```

One container serves both the API and the dashboard — no second image, no second
origin. Provider keys go in a repository-root `.env` or the environment.
[deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) has the full reference, including a
self-contained PostgreSQL pairing and the fullstack observability stack.

### Kubernetes via Helm

```bash
helm repo add ferro-labs https://ferro-labs.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install ferro-gw ferro-labs/ai-gateway \
  --set env.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

## Migrate to Ferro Labs AI Gateway

The gateway is OpenAI-compatible, so for a client already using an
OpenAI-compatible SDK, migration — from another gateway or from calling a
provider directly — is a `base_url` and `api_key` change: point the SDK at the
gateway and present a gateway-issued credential in place of the provider's own.
A client with its own API, such as LiteLLM's `completion()` below, also moves to
the OpenAI SDK.

### From LiteLLM

**Before (LiteLLM):**

```python
from litellm import completion

response = completion(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

**After (Ferro Labs AI Gateway):**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1",
    api_key="your-ferro-api-key",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
```

Provider API keys move to environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, …); the model list becomes `targets` + `aliases` in
`config.yaml`.

**Why migrate from LiteLLM:**

- 14x higher throughput at 150 concurrent users (2,447 vs 175 RPS)
- 23x less memory at peak load (47 MB vs 1,124 MB under streaming)
- Single binary — no Python environment, no pip, no virtualenv
- Predictable latency — p99 stays under 65 ms at 150 VU vs LiteLLM's timeouts at the same concurrency

### From Portkey

The code change is the same one line — Ferro Labs uses the standard OpenAI SDK
with no custom headers in self-hosted mode.

**Why migrate from Portkey:**

- Fully open source — no per-request pricing, no log limits
- Self-hosted — the gateway runs in your infrastructure, and prompts reach only the providers you configure
- No vendor lock-in — Apache 2.0 license
- MCP support — Portkey self-hosted lacks native MCP
- FerroCloud (coming soon) for teams that want a managed service

---

## Performance

Every figure in this section comes from one run: **Ferro Labs v1.0.0, measured
2026-03-23**. Benchmarked against Kong OSS, Bifrost, LiteLLM, and Portkey on
**GCP n2-standard-8** (8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM) using a **60ms fixed-latency
mock upstream** — results reflect gateway overhead only. Later releases have not
been re-measured; reproduce against the version you intend to run using the
commands below.

![Throughput comparison — Ferro Labs vs Kong, Bifrost, LiteLLM, Portkey across 150–1,000 VU](docs/benchmarks/throughput-comparison.png)

| VU | RPS | p50 | p99 | Memory |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 50 | 813 | 61.3ms | 64.1ms | 36 MB |
| 150 | 2,447 | 61.2ms | 63.4ms | 47 MB |
| 300 | 4,890 | 61.2ms | 64.4ms | 72 MB |
| 500 | 8,014 | 61.5ms | 72.9ms | 89 MB |
| 1,000 | 13,925 | 68.1ms | 111.9ms | 135 MB |

At 1,000 VU: **13,925 RPS**, p50 overhead **8.1ms**, memory **135 MB**.
Against the live OpenAI API, the gateway itself adds **25 microseconds** p50 in
a typical plugin configuration, and **2 microseconds** with no plugins enabled.
