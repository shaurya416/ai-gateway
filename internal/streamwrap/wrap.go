// Package streamwrap provides a metering wrapper for streaming LLM responses.
// It transparently forwards SSE chunks while accumulating token-usage data and
// emitting the same Prometheus metrics and event hooks that non-streaming
// requests emit via Gateway.Route().
//
// # Stream-send drain contract (load-bearing invariant)
//
// Provider CompleteStream implementations spawn a goroutine that produces
// chunks with an UNGUARDED, blocking send: `ch <- chunk` (no select on
// ctx.Done(), no buffering guarantee). That goroutine therefore only stays
// leak-free as long as SOMETHING keeps reading ch until the provider closes
// it. Meter is that something: on consumer abandonment or context
// cancellation it does not simply stop — it ALWAYS continues to drain src to
// completion (`for range src`) so the blocked provider send can proceed and
// the provider goroutine can run to its `close(ch)` and exit.
//
// Consequence: any consumer that reads a provider stream channel DIRECTLY
// (bypassing Meter) and stops reading early — on client disconnect, an error,
// an early break, or a panic — will permanently block the provider's
// `ch <- chunk`, leaking that goroutine (and whatever it holds: the HTTP
// response body, connections, buffers) for the life of the process. Always
// route provider streams through Meter, or replicate its full drain-on-abort
// behaviour. Do not "optimise" Meter to stop draining src early; that would
// reintroduce the leak.
