// therefore counts as the operator having set it; the other is translated into

// hardened to owner-only 0600 before the driver touches it: a file created
// under the process umask is world-readable until something narrows it, and the
// stores hold secrets. For Postgres a dsn is required and defaultDSN is unused.
//
// The connection pool is tuned for the dialect and the connection is verified
// with PingContext before returning. On any failure after sql.Open the
// half-open pool is closed so no descriptor leaks.
//
// # SQLite and concurrent writers
//
// SQLite locks the whole database file for a write, so every writer against one
// file is serialized whether it lives in this process or another. A default
// busy timeout is applied (see sqliteBusyTimeout) so a blocked writer waits its
// turn instead of failing immediately, which is what makes two stores sharing
// one file work.
//
// That makes contention survivable, not free. Waiting is still waiting, and
// nothing here coordinates schema migrations between processes: two gateway
// instances starting against one SQLite file race to apply them, and the loser
// waits out the timeout and then fails its startup. Run one gateway process per
// SQLite file. A multi-instance deployment belongs on Postgres, which is what
// every store's backend setting offers for exactly this reason.
