// not as backpressure: a refused /readyz removes the instance from service and
// a refused /livez restarts it. Rate limiting a probe therefore hands anyone who
// can reach the port — these routes are unauthenticated — a switch that takes
// the instance out of rotation, and /readyz is the worse half of that, because
// /livez keeps answering 200 and nothing ever restarts the process.
//
// /readyz was previously bounded by a process-global token bucket, on the
// reasoning that it fans out to Ping() calls against the key store and config
// manager on every request and that ceiling belongs to the stores rather than to
// any one caller. The ceiling is real; the instrument was wrong. The two goals
// only conflict while every request performs the fan-out, so the handler now
// caches its evaluated answer for readyzCacheTTL (internal/handler/health.go)

// most one evaluation per TTL regardless of caller count or source address —
// and no probe is ever refused.

// mountObservabilityRoutes mounts the auth-gated /metrics, /debug/vars, and

//
// A dashboard session must authenticate here, not only on /admin/*: the web

// routes on the key chain alone made them unreadable from the UI that exists to
// display them. A session carries the scopes of the credential it was minted
// from, so accepting one grants nothing the same operator could not already
// reach with that credential directly.
//
// sessionStore must be the same instance mountAdminRoutes is handed, for the
// reason spelled out there: the middleware re-checks each session's source
// credential against keyStore, so a second store 401s every non-synthetic
// session.
//
// The group is split into two scope tiers rather than gated as one block,
// because a monitoring system scraping /metrics and an engineer pulling a heap
// dump are different actors and forcing them onto one credential tier is its
// own problem: a scraper's bearer sits unattended in a config file on every
// node that runs one, so the cheapest way to make it admin-tier is the reason
// not to. Production systems that authorize these paths at all draw the line in
// the same place — Kubernetes' built-in system:monitoring role grants /metrics,
// /healthz*, /livez*, and /readyz* and nothing under /debug, which needs an
// explicit non-resource grant or cluster-admin; Consul reads metrics with
// agent:read but pprof with operator:read; CockroachDB's debug pages want the
// admin role or VIEWDEBUG.
//
//   - /metrics is the monitoring tier (read-only or admin): counters and
//     histograms, the same class of state /admin/dashboard already serves to a
//     read-only credential.
//   - Everything under /debug is the operator tier (admin only): a heap or
//     goroutine profile is a memory image that can hold request bodies, keys,
//     and prompts, /debug/pprof/profile and /trace stop the world long enough
//     to be a denial-of-service primitive, and /debug/vars is grouped here
//     rather than with metrics because expvar publishes cmdline by default —
//     the process argv, not a counter.
//
// Scope is checked here and not left to the fact that pprof needs ENABLE_PPROF:
// that flag decides whether the routes exist, never who may call them.
//
// Both routes are read-only reporters, so both are narrowed to GET (and the HEAD
// onlyMethod pairs with it). They were registered for every method, which meant
// PUT /metrics returned the whole metric dump and POST /debug/vars returned
// expvar including the process command line — neither endpoint has a write
// surface to reach, but answering 200 to a method that means "write" describes
// the resource wrongly and leaves it the one place a 405 could never be raised.
// A Prometheus scrape is a GET (the exposition format defines no other method)
// and expvar is a GET; nothing in this repository calls either with anything else.
//
// pprof is deliberately not narrowed the same way and keeps its own per-method
// registration: /debug/pprof/symbol genuinely serves POST, which is how
// `go tool pprof` submits a batch of addresses to symbolize.
