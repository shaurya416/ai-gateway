// Get resolves it to a provider.

// BatchHandler returns an http.HandlerFunc that transparently forwards the Files
// (/v1/files*) and Batch (/v1/batches*) endpoints to the one configured batch
// target, injecting that provider's credential.
//
// Unlike the /v1/* pass-through, this surface does NOT resolve a provider per
// request: files and batches carry no model, and a bare file/batch id is an
// opaque, provider-scoped string with no routing hint. A single configured
// backend serves them all, so an id minted on POST /v1/files resolves against
// the same backend on every later retrieve, cancel or download — no gateway
// state, native ids preserved. When no batch_target is configured the surface is
// off and every route answers 501.
//
// It reuses the /v1/* proxy's security machinery: path-traversal refusal before
// any credential is installed, response credential redaction bounded by
// sanitizeScanBudget, and the streaming idle bound that stands in for the
// cleared WriteTimeout. A large multipart file upload streams straight through
// (no body-size cap here — the upstream enforces its own), so this handler must
// be mounted outside the shared request-body limit.
//
//nolint:dupl // deliberately parallel to ResponsesIDs — both are single configured-target forwarders; a shared helper would hide their different config source (BatchTarget vs ResponsesTarget) and provider seam (BatchProvider vs ProxiableProvider)
