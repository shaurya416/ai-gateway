// resolved, so the caller can tell "you named no model" from "nothing serves the

// X-Provider is NOT gated on model ownership, deliberately. Ownership gating
// exists to stop the gateway PICKING a provider for a name it cannot place; a
// header is the caller placing it themselves. It is also the only way to reach
// the endpoints this proxy exists for whose model ids no index can enumerate — a
// fine-tune job's base model, a /v1/responses model newer than the catalog — so
// gating it would leave those unreachable with no escape hatch. The header is
// therefore both the explicit choice and the documented override for a model
// the index does not own.
//
// It IS gated on target membership, which is a different question and was the
// hole: the header's only bound used to be "a provider this instance has
// credentials for", and a credential present in the environment is not a
// provider the operator configured. Requiring a target keeps the escape hatch
// whole — an unenumerable model still resolves — while refusing to send a body
