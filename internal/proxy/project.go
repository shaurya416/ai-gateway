// projectionCap bounds how much of a request body the pass-through will buffer
// in order to project it as text for a content guardrail.
//
// It exists because this surface carries bodies the routed surfaces never see:
// a /v1/files upload or a /v1/audio/transcriptions payload can be hundreds of
// megabytes, and buffering one to search it for prose would trade a governance
// gap for an out-of-memory. Past the cap the body is reported UNINSPECTABLE
// rather than partially inspected — a guardrail shown the first megabyte of a
// body has not screened the body, and reporting a partial read as a full one is
// the same silent pass this whole path exists to close.
//
// This is the same bound Envoy's ext_authz draws, and it fails the same way:
// its with_request_body has a max_request_bytes past which the request is
// refused with a 413, explicitly overriding failure_mode_allow.
const projectionCap = 1 << 20 // 1 MiB

// projectBody returns a best-effort text projection of a JSON request body,
// together with whether that projection can be trusted to contain everything a
// content guardrail would want to read.
//
// The body is always restored, so the caller can forward it afterwards exactly
// as it arrived.
//
// What a projection covers: every STRING VALUE anywhere in a JSON body, at any
// depth, joined by newlines. That deliberately over-collects — a model id, a
// file name and a tool name land in it alongside the prose — because a
// guardrail seeing more than the prompt can only produce a false refusal, while
// a guardrail seeing less than the prompt produces a forwarded violation. Keys
// are not collected: they are the schema, not the caller's content.
//
// What it cannot cover, and so reports as uninspectable:
//
//   - a body that is not JSON at all — a multipart /v1/files upload, raw audio
//   - a body larger than projectionCap
//   - a body that is malformed JSON, or that could not be read
//
// A body that is absent or empty is inspectable and projects to nothing: a GET
// /v1/files or a DELETE carries no content, so there is nothing a guardrail was
// prevented from seeing. That is a different fact from "there is content and it
// could not be read", and only the second one has to fail closed.
//
// text-only projection. Base64 inside a JSON string is collected as
// the base64, which no blocklist will match — decoding every string that looks
// like base64 is a decoder, not a projection. Add it when a deployment actually
// needs to screen inline attachments.
//
// model is the body's top-level "model" string when the projection read one,
// empty otherwise; the decode that projects the body has already found it.
