// it to decide what fails open (errorFailsOpen), whether a transform may
// rewrite the routed model, and whether a guardrail reads request content.
// budget reports TypeRateLimit purely to reach the 429 branch below, and using
// a policy axis as a status selector is what produced this bug — a new
// PluginType existing only to select a status would repeat it one name along.
// Moving budget to TypeGuardrail is worse: it declares no ContentAgnostic, so
// it would enrol in Manager.HasBeforeRequestGuardrail and start refusing
// uninspectable /v1/* pass-through bodies in deployments running no content
// guardrail at all.

// retryAfterSeconds is the Retry-After hint sent with a 429 the GATEWAY decided

// The header is what makes the 429 work. openai-go retries 429 by default
// (internal/requestconfig.shouldRetry: 408, 409, 429, >=500) and reads
// Retry-After-Ms then Retry-After to decide how long to wait; with no hint it
// falls back to its own half-second-and-doubling schedule, so the rejections
// meant to relieve pressure are what produce the next burst. The Anthropic SDKs
// behave the same way.
//
// It is deliberately a constant rather than a figure derived from the limiter's
// own queue. The limiter knows its in-flight count and queue depth, but
// Retry-After is a TIME, and converting a queue depth into one needs a drain
// rate the limiter never measures — it would have to assume a per-request
// service time, which for an LLM call ranges from under a second to minutes and
// varies by model and prompt. A number computed from that assumption is
// confidently wrong rather than approximately right, and openai-go discards any
// hint of a minute or more outright (requestconfig.retryDelay), so an
// overestimate silently degrades to the SDK's own backoff having bought
// nothing. One second is the honest floor: it is short enough to always be
// worth honouring and it never claims to know when capacity returns. Measuring
// the drain rate is the upgrade path if a precise hint is ever worth its cost.

//
//   - 429 stays 429. It is the one status where the upstream's instruction and the
//     caller's correct behaviour coincide: everyone slows down.
//   - 401/403 become 502. The credential the provider rejected is the operator's,

//     and OpenAI SDKs surface it as an authentication failure that discards the
//     session. What is broken is the gateway's upstream leg, so it is reported as
//     an upstream fault.
//   - 400/422 pass through. The provider read the translated request and rejected

//     provider — over its byte limit, or the context window a provider reports
//     with this status rather than 400 — and only the caller can shrink it.
//   - 404 is the model: the provider does not serve what was asked for, which the

//   - Timeouts become 504 and everything else becomes 502 — the gateway reached a
