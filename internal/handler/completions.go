// of them in more than one JSON shape (prompt: string | []string | []int |

// `stop` as a bare string, which is representable and must be accepted.
// shimPrompt/shimStop decode them per shape so each is either translated or
// refused with a message naming what is wrong.

// Completions handles POST /v1/completions (legacy text completion API).

// The prompt is wrapped as a single user message and routed through the same

// aliases, routing strategy, plugins, circuit breakers, per-target concurrency
// limits, metrics, and request logging all apply here. The chat response is
// then re-wrapped in the legacy completions envelope.
//
// There is deliberately no pass-through to a provider's own /v1/completions
// route. An opaque body forwarded upstream carries none of the above: a
// guardrail cannot read it, a budget cannot bill it, and a provider excluded
// from `targets` is reachable through it. Requests the chat surface cannot
// express — prompt batches, token-id prompts, streaming — are refused with an
// explicit 400 instead.
//
// # Legacy-only fields
//
// Four fields exist on /v1/completions and have no chat equivalent. One is
// honoured and three are accepted and ignored. Nothing in the response says
// which is which — an ignored field produces a perfectly ordinary 200 — so it
// is stated here and in the endpoint's operator documentation:
//
//   - echo — HONOURED. Each choice's text is the prompt followed by the
//     completion, which is what "echo back the prompt in addition to the
//     completion" means. It describes the response envelope and nothing else,
//     so the shim reproduces it exactly: the request sent upstream is
//     unchanged, and usage still counts only the tokens the model generated.
//   - suffix — ACCEPTED AND IGNORED. It is not a response format. It is text
//     the model is asked to generate INTO: the completion returned is the
//     middle that bridges prompt and suffix, and the suffix itself is never
//     part of it. A chat call cannot be conditioned on it, so appending it to
//     the answer would return text the model never wrote and that OpenAI never
//     returns — an approximation that looks right and is not.
//   - best_of — ACCEPTED AND IGNORED. It picks among candidates generated
//     server-side, ranked by log probability per token; the chat surface
//     neither generates the candidates nor scores them.
//   - logprobs — ACCEPTED AND IGNORED. A chat completion carries no token log
//     probabilities, so every choice reports logprobs: null.
//
// Ignored means exactly that: none of the three is rejected. Refusing one would
// turn a request callers send today into a 400.
