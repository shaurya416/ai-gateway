// recordAudit records one administrative action to the structured log and,
// when an audit store is configured, to the durable trail.
//
// Until the trail existed, mutations were logged only when they failed: a
// successful deletion of the last admin key produced no record anywhere, which
// made "who deleted the admin key" unanswerable. Every audited action now leaves
// both a log line and a queryable row.
//
// The store write is best-effort and never fails the action being audited. The
// default backend is in-memory and the SQL one is a database that can be down;
// failing key management because its audit row could not be written trades a
// missing row for a broken admin API, which is the worse outcome. A failed
// append is logged and the request proceeds — and the log line above it is the
// fallback record, so the action is never entirely unrecorded. This is why the
// method takes the request rather than a context: source_ip comes from the
// resolved r.RemoteAddr (see RealIPMiddleware), which the trail exists to
// capture on a denied sign-in.
//
// attrs are alternating key/value pairs, as passed to a structured logger; they
// become the JSON detail on the stored row. The store redacts detail as a
// backstop, but callers must still pass only identifiers and names here, never a
// bearer secret.
