// existing scopes alone — so demanding the field would break every client that
// has never sent it without catching a single typo.
//
// Unknown scopes are refused rather than ignored. Ignoring them is the right
// answer where the party issuing a credential and the party enforcing it are
// separate systems on separate release trains: there, a scope the issuer does
// not recognize may still mean something to a resource server, so rejecting it
// breaks a newer client talking to an older issuer for no gain. That is not
// this system. The gateway mints these scopes and is the only thing that ever
// enforces them, both from the same binary, so a scope this code does not know
// grants exactly nothing and can never come to mean anything. Accepting one
// issues a credential that authenticates, lists as valid in GET /admin/keys,
// and is refused by every route it is presented to — a typo whose only symptom
// arrives in production. RFC 6749 §3.3 leaves the choice to the server and
// defines invalid_scope for precisely this refusal.
//
// The forward-compatibility cost is real but small and bounded: a newer client
// asking this gateway for a scope it cannot grant now fails at creation with a
// message naming the accepted set, instead of receiving a credential that does
// not work. The message carries the valid list for the same reason a discovery
