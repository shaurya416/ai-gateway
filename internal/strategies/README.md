# Routing strategies

A **strategy** decides the *order* in which a request's candidate targets are
tried — and only that. Retry, the circuit breaker, per-target concurrency, error
classification, metrics and request logging live in the gateway's request
pipeline, one layer up, so they behave identically under every strategy. (This is
the split Envoy makes too: the route table and load balancer say *where* a
request may go, while the retry policy and circuit breaker hang off the route and
the cluster.)

Pick a strategy with `strategy.mode`. Every target names a `virtual_key` (a
provider), and a request routes only to targets that serve its model. One
ranking serves every surface: chat, streaming, embeddings, images, rerank,
moderation, transcription and speech order the same targets the same way for the
same config and health, with one difference — a target whose provider cannot
serve the surface at all is not a candidate there, so a chat-only target never
takes an embeddings request's share of a weighted draw. See
[`../../config.example.yaml`](../../config.example.yaml) for the full config
reference with inline comments.

```yaml
strategy:
  mode: fallback
targets:
  - virtual_key: openai
  - virtual_key: anthropic
```

## Two families

What a strategy does when its chosen target *fails* splits the eight modes in two:

| Family | Modes | On a failure |
|---|---|---|
| **Pool** | fallback, load-balance, least-latency, cost-optimized, ab-test | the request advances only after a failover-safe failure |
| **Named** | single, conditional, content-based | the request stays inside what was named: `single` stops; a rule walks its `target_keys` chain under the same failover-safe classes and stops at its end |

A pool mode picks its target for a reason about the *pool* (spread load, take the
cheapest, take the fastest, split traffic), so carrying a failed request to a
sibling is what was asked for. A named mode picks *specific* targets (you named
it, or a rule matched it), so serving from anywhere else would demote the rule
to a suggestion. A rule's chain is a boundary: members whose circuit is open or
that are parked after a `429` are skipped for the next member, and a target the
rule did not name is never substituted — a rule with one target is exact, and
its target being down is the corresponding error.

Failover-safe failures are transport failures, an attempt that timed out
waiting on the target, 408, 429, 5xx, open circuits, target saturation, and a
provider's own statement that the prompt exceeded its context window (the
OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic and Gemini envelopes are recognised; a sibling's
model may have a larger window). The request's own cancellation or deadline and
every other 4xx stop at the current target. `strategy.failover_on_status_codes`
adds statuses of your own (`[409]`, say); it cannot add the caller's
cancellation or deadline, nor 400, 401, 403, 404 or 422.

Under **every** mode, a target whose **circuit breaker is open** is skipped when
the choice is made, so a backend the gateway has already decided not to call
takes no traffic while a healthy target is configured — among the candidates the
mode offers, which for a rule is its chain. When every candidate's
circuit is open the request is still attempted and answered `503`. A target
that answered `429` is skipped the same way until its `Retry-After` elapses
(capped at a minute; five seconds when the header is missing), without its
breaker counting the rate limit as a failure. Breaker, latency and cooldown
state are all local to one gateway process.

## The strategies

### single
Always the first configured target. A request for a model that target does not
serve is `model_not_found`, even if another configured target serves it — give
such a model its own target and a mode that can reach it.

### fallback
Tries targets in configured order and moves to the next after a failover-safe
failure.

```yaml
strategy: { mode: fallback }
```

### load-balance
Distributes requests across targets by `weight`. A weight of `0` drains a target
(no traffic) without removing it; at least one weight must be positive.

```yaml
strategy: { mode: load-balance }
targets:
  - { virtual_key: openai, weight: 3 }
  - { virtual_key: azure-openai, weight: 1 }
```

`sticky: { on: user, ttl: 1h }` pins each request to the same target for the
same `user` field — a stateless hash, so a conversation keeps its provider
prompt cache without any shared state, and every replica with this config
answers the same. A request with no `user` draws at random; `ttl` bounds how
long a pin can hold. Also available under `ab-test`, where it keeps a session on
its variant.

### least-latency

Routes to the target with the lowest observed p50 latency, so traffic follows
the currently-fastest backend. The sample is the time a target took to *begin*
answering — a stream's first chunk, or a unary call's response — so a model with
long answers does not read as a slow provider. Samples are kept per target and
upstream model, expire after five minutes (a target nothing has measured
recently is treated as unseen and measured again), and one request in ten leads
with a sampled non-leader so a sibling that recovered is noticed. Health is
per process; nothing is shared between gateway instances.

```yaml
strategy: { mode: least-latency }
```

### cost-optimized

Routes to the cheapest catalog-priced target. Each candidate is priced from the
catalog's rate for the model's mode — input plus output for chat (the output
estimate is the request's `max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens`, or 256), per
token for embeddings, per image, per minute or character for audio — so the
order is a comparison of list prices, not a prediction of what the request will
cost. Targets that price the same draw by `weight`, equally when none is set.
`unpriced_strategy` decides what happens for a target the catalog has no price
for:

| `unpriced_strategy` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `fallback` (default) | prefer priced targets, then the first compatible unpriced one |
| `skip` | reject unpriced candidates |
| `allow` | treat a missing price as zero cost |

```yaml
strategy:
  mode: cost-optimized
  unpriced_strategy: fallback
```

### conditional
Routes by the value of a request field. Rules are evaluated in order, first match
wins; when no rule matches, the request goes to the fallback target. Supported
keys: `model`, `model_prefix`, `user` (the request's `user` field), `stream` and
`has_tools` (`"true"` / `"false"`), and `metadata`, which reads one entry —
named by `field` — of the single `X-Gateway-Metadata` request header: a JSON
object of at most 32 string, number or boolean values within 4 KiB, accepted on
`/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/completions` and never forwarded to a provider.
No other header is ever exposed to a rule. `user` also applies to embeddings and
image requests, which carry the field; `stream` and `has_tools` are chat-only,
and `metadata` matches nothing on the surfaces that do not accept the header.

```yaml
strategy:
  mode: conditional
  conditions:
    - { key: model, value: gpt-4o, target_key: openai }
    - { key: model_prefix, value: claude, target_keys: [anthropic, bedrock] }
    - { key: metadata, field: tier, value: gold, target_key: openai }
    - { key: has_tools, value: "true", target_key: openai }
```

`target_key` names one target; `target_keys` an ordered chain, tried in order
under the failover-safe classes above and never left. Both are exact
about what they name. `model` and `model_prefix` require a non-empty `value`
with no surrounding whitespace, and `user` a non-empty one — matching is
verbatim, so a padded or empty `model` can match nothing, an empty `user` never
matches, and an empty `model_prefix` would match every model and swallow every
rule below it. A padded `user` value is legal: the request's `user` is compared
as sent. A `model` value that names a global alias is refused at load: aliases
resolve before routing, so the rule would compare a request whose model already
reads as the alias's target, and never match — write the target instead.

### content-based
Routes by the textual content of the prompt. Rules evaluate in order, first match
wins; no match falls back to the first target. Supported types: `prompt_contains`,
`prompt_not_contains`, `prompt_regex`.

```yaml
strategy:
  mode: content-based
  content_conditions:
    - { type: prompt_regex, value: "(?i)\\b(code|function)\\b", target_key: deepseek }
    - { type: prompt_contains, value: "translate", target_key: gemini }
```

### ab-test
Splits traffic across labelled variants by weight (relative shares). A `0`-weight
variant receives nothing — how you drain one before removing it; at least one
weight must be positive.

```yaml
strategy:
  mode: ab-test
  ab_variants:
    - { target_key: openai, weight: 70, label: control }
    - { target_key: anthropic, weight: 30, label: challenger }
```

Labels are required and unique (case-insensitively — `control` and `Control`
are one arm to anyone reading a trace).

The label names the variant the request was *drawn* for and stays with the
request through same-target retries and failover, so an experiment is segmented
by intent. Which target actually served is on every `gateway.routing.attempt`
event and on the terminal event's provider — read it when a variant's circuit is
open, because the draw still happens and the sibling serves under the drawn
label.

## `/v1/models` stays in step

The model listing reflects what the *active* mode would actually route: a model
absent from `/v1/models` is the signal that routing would refuse it. So under a
named mode, list only the models the configured rules/target can reach.

## Quick check

`scripts/strategy_smoke.sh` exercises all eight strategies (and their edge cases)
end-to-end against live providers and prints a PASS/FAIL summary.
