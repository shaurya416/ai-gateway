// breaker, the concurrency limit and error classification are identical on both
// surfaces; when no configured target serves the model the request is refused,
// because targets is an allowlist. Once CompleteStream succeeds, nothing is
// retried or replayed. Target selection, each CompleteStream call, and the
// retry/backoff waits between them are bounded by Config.RequestTimeout, if
// configured; a stream that does start is never bounded by it once its channel
// is visible below — see startStreamWithStrategy and raceCompleteStream.
// Prometheus metrics and event hooks are emitted when the returned channel
// drains (matching the behaviour of Route for non-streaming).
//
// When MCP servers are configured the request is routed through Route instead
// so that the full agentic tool-call loop can run. The final response is
// wrapped into a single-chunk stream and returned to the caller (Phase 1
// behaviour — true final-response streaming is Phase 1.5).
