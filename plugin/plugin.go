// Package plugin defines the Plugin interface and the lifecycle stages
// used to hook into the gateway request pipeline.
//
// Plugins are registered by name via RegisterFactory and loaded by the
// gateway at startup. The plugin.Context carries the request and response
// through each stage, and plugins may modify, reject, or skip requests.
//
// # Rejection and failure
//
// A plugin can end a request two ways, and the gateway treats them differently:
//
//   - Rejection — the plugin ran and DECIDED to deny the request, by setting
//     Context.Reject. This is always honoured, for every plugin type, and reaches
//     the client as a RejectionError: a 429 for a rate-limit plugin, a 4xx for
//     anything else.
//   - Failure — the plugin BROKE: it returned an error or panicked, so it never
//     reached a decision. Guardrail, auth, ratelimit, transform, and any unknown
//     plugin type fail closed, aborting the request with a FailureError, which the
//     client sees as a 500. Logging and metrics plugins fail open — a dead log sink
//     watches the request, it does not gate it — so their errors are logged and the
//     request proceeds.
//
// The distinction matters at the wire: a rate-limit plugin whose backend is down has
// not rate-limited anyone, and answering 429 would invite every SDK to retry into
// the outage. It is a server fault, and the gateway reports it as one.
//
// Note that an after_request plugin on a streaming response runs once the stream has
// already been delivered chunk by chunk. It can observe the completed response, but
// it cannot unsend it — a guardrail that must withhold content has to run at
// before_request, or the caller must not stream.
//
// # Stages and short-circuiting
//
// Skipping the provider and skipping the rest of the chain are different acts, and
// a plugin can only do the first:
//
//   - Context.SkipProvider says "do not call the provider; serve Context.Response
//     instead". Every remaining before_request plugin still runs, and so does
//     after_request. A cache hit therefore no longer disables the rate limiter or
//     the budget registered behind it.
//   - Only a rejection or a failure ends the before_request chain, and it ends that
//     stage alone: the on_error stage still runs, so a request denied by policy is
//     still recorded by whatever observes requests.
//
// SkipProvider stays set through after_request, where it is a fact rather than a
// control signal: it is how a plugin tells a request served from cache from one that
// reached a provider. Cost recording keys off it; logging deliberately does not.
//
// Context.Stage names the stage currently executing. Branch on it. Do not infer the
// stage from which fields happen to be nil — a before_request plugin can now observe
// a Response an earlier plugin put there.
//
// # Removed in v1.4.0
//
// Context.Skip is gone. It meant "abandon every plugin after me", which let a cache
// hit bypass every guardrail behind it. Code that sets or reads it no longer
// compiles; the replacement is SkipProvider, whose contract is above.
//
// Built-in plugins live in the plugin/* subpackages and are registered
// by importing them with a blank import (e.g. _ "github.com/ferro-labs/ai-gateway/plugin/wordfilter").

// nothing is assumed to read content and still triggers the refusal, so an

// never silently reclassified into forwarding an unscreened body upstream under
// the gateway's own credential. Over-refusal is recoverable; that is not.
