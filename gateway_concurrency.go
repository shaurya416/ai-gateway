// Per-target concurrency limiting: a semaphore applied at the call site, composed
// inside the circuit breaker.
//
// This deliberately is NOT a worker pool. The gateway's execution model is direct
// synchronous provider calls wrapped by thin call-site decorators (see cbProvider);
// a pre-spawned per-provider worker pool would layer a second, foreign execution
// model on top of it, add a goroutine hop and result marshalling to every request,
// and — because a pooled wrapper has to be stored in the registry — force the
// wrapper to re-expose every optional interface of the provider it wraps. A wrapper
// that advertises capabilities its inner provider lacks silently corrupts
// capability detection (model indexing, discovery, proxy eligibility), which is
// exactly the trap this design avoids: like cbProvider, limitedProvider embeds the
// base Provider interface only and is built per call, never stored.

// request never occupies a slot.
//
// Both sheds carry ErrProviderSaturated, because both are the gateway turning work
// away under its own concurrency limit rather than anything the target did. That
// distinction is what keeps the target's circuit breaker out of it: a request shed
// from the queue never reached the provider, and blaming it would open the breaker
