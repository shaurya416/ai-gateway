# Observability

The gateway emits an OpenTelemetry trace for every request it routes. This
package is the seam between the gateway and whatever records those traces: it
defines the stable `Provider`, `Span`, `Exporter` and `Event` contracts and the
`gen_ai.*` / `ferro.*` attribute names, and ships a zero-allocation no-op default
so tracing costs nothing until it is turned on.

Point it at any OTLP collector — Jaeger, New Relic, LangSmith, Grafana Tempo,
Honeycomb, Datadog — over gRPC or HTTP. The wiring (OTLP exporter, W3C
`traceparent` propagation, sampler) lives in [`../internal/otel`](../internal/otel);
this package is the public contract that wiring implements. For the full config
reference with inline comments see [`../config.example.yaml`](../config.example.yaml).

  <em>A single <code>gateway.request</code> trace in Jaeger — the plugin stages, the upstream provider call, and the span opened to show its <code>gen_ai.*</code> / <code>ferro.*</code> attributes.</em>

## Turn it on

Set one environment variable:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
ferrogw serve
```

…or add an `observability.tracing` block to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
observability:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: localhost:4317   # URL or host:port; blank reads OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*
    protocol: grpc             # grpc | http/protobuf
    service_name: ferrogw
    sample_ratio: 1.0          # head sampler (0.0–1.0), wrapped in ParentBased
    privacy_level: metadata    # none | metadata | full
    shutdown_grace: 10s        # per shutdown stage
    attempt_spans: false       # one gateway.routing.attempt span per routing attempt
    propagate_passthrough: true # traceparent on /v1/* pass-through forwards
```

Either the config `endpoint` or an `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` variable switches
tracing on; the environment variable wins when both are set.

## Endpoint and transport

The `endpoint` is a **base** URL, treated the way the OTLP specification treats
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`:

- Under `protocol: http/protobuf`, the traces signal path `v1/traces` is appended
  for you — so `https://host` becomes `https://host/v1/traces`, and a base that
  already ends in `v1/traces` is used as written rather than doubled.
- Under `protocol: grpc`, only the scheme and host are used.
- The **scheme selects transport security**: `https://` is TLS, `http://` and a
  bare `host:port` (e.g. `localhost:4317`) are plaintext. Managed backends need
  the `https://` form.
- A bare `host:port` in `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` or
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` follows the OTLP specification instead:
  TLS, unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE` (or
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_INSECURE`) is `true`. Write a plaintext collector
  in those variables as an `http://` URL.

An endpoint the exporter cannot understand is rejected at startup rather than
failing silently per batch. The startup log prints the exact URL spans are posted
to.

## Managed backends

`headers` carries per-backend authentication. Use `${ENV_VAR}` references for
secrets — only the reference is stored in the config and returned by the admin
config API; the value is resolved from the environment when the exporter is built
and is never persisted.

| Backend | Endpoint | Protocol | Header(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **New Relic** | `https://otlp.nr-data.net` (EU: `otlp.eu01.nr-data.net`) | `http/protobuf` | `api-key: <ingest license key>` |
| **LangSmith** | `https://api.smith.langchain.com/otel` | `http/protobuf` | `x-api-key`, `Langsmith-Project` |
| **Jaeger** (self-hosted) | `localhost:4317` | `grpc` | none |

**New Relic** — use the account's **ingest license** key, not a User key:

```yaml
observability:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: https://otlp.nr-data.net
    protocol: http/protobuf
    headers:
      api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}
```

**LangSmith** — the traces path is appended to the `/otel` base automatically:

```yaml
observability:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: https://api.smith.langchain.com/otel
    protocol: http/protobuf
    headers:
      x-api-key: ${LANGSMITH_API_KEY}
      Langsmith-Project: ferrogw
```

The standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable applies only
while `headers` is unset: a configured `headers` map replaces the variable
rather than adding to it, so keep all of one backend's headers in one of the
two places. An API key in the variable and a project header in `headers`
exports without the key.

## Try it locally with Jaeger

```bash
docker run -d --name jaeger -p 16686:16686 -p 4317:4317 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 ferrogw serve
# send a request, then open http://localhost:16686 and search for service "ferrogw"
```

Each request shows up as a `gateway.request` span with its plugin stages and the
upstream provider call as children (see the trace above). Open the span and it
carries the full `gen_ai.*` semantic conventions plus the `ferro.*` extensions —
model, provider, token usage, routing decision, and per-request cost.

For the full stack — the gateway wired to Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger with
generated traffic in one command — see [`../deploy/compose.fullstack.yaml`](../deploy/compose.fullstack.yaml)
(`make up-fullstack`).

## What gets emitted

Every routed request produces a `gateway.request` root span (`SERVER` kind) and a
`CLIENT` child span per outbound provider call, which carries `traceparent`
upstream. The `/v1/*` pass-through and the fixed-target forwards
(`/v1/responses` create and its id sub-routes, `/v1/files`, `/v1/batches`)
forward `traceparent` too (turn it off with `propagate_passthrough: false`);
neither emits an extra span of its own. A caller's own `traceparent` and
`tracestate` are dropped before forwarding either way, so a provider sees this
gateway's trace context or none, never the caller's.

- **GenAI semantic conventions**: `gen_ai.system`, `gen_ai.operation.name`,
  `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`,
  `gen_ai.usage.{input,output}_tokens`.
- **Request identity**: `enduser.id`, `session.id`, and one
  `ferro.request.metadata.<key>` per metadata entry — see
  [Request identity](#request-identity).
- **`ferro.*` extensions**: `ferro.cost.*` (per-request USD cost),
  `ferro.routing.{strategy,target_key,attempt}`, `ferro.stream.time_to_{first,last}_token_ms`,
  `ferro.plugin.*`, `ferro.mcp.*`, `ferro.gateway.trace_id`.
- **Per-attempt spans** (`attempt_spans: true`): one `gateway.routing.attempt`
  `CLIENT` span per routing-layer attempt — retries and failovers included —
  under the request span, carrying `ferro.routing.target_key`,
  `ferro.routing.sequence` (1-based) and `ferro.routing.outcome`
  (`success` | `error`). On chat, embeddings and images the provider's HTTP
  span nests beneath it; on a streamed request the attempt span ends when the
  stream starts, so the HTTP span is its sibling — see `AttemptSpanProvider`.
  Either way a trace shows which targets were tried and in what order. Off by default because a
  request that retried produces several, and a dashboard that counts spans
  per request would over-count.
- **Unified trace ID**: the OTel `trace_id`, the `X-Request-ID` response header,
  and the `trace_id` on every log line are equal for a request served through the
  gateway's HTTP stack. A 32-hex `X-Request-ID` sent by the caller is adopted
  unchanged.
- **Sampling**: `sample_ratio` governs the spans the gateway starts. The sampler
  is `ParentBased`, so an inbound sampled `traceparent` is always followed — a
  ratio below 1.0 never splits a distributed trace.

## Request identity

A request can say who it is for. The gateway records that on the request span,
on every `gateway.request.completed` / `gateway.request.failed` /
`gateway.routing.attempt` event (`Event.User`, `Event.SessionID`,
`Event.Metadata`, and the same fields on `RoutingAttempt`), and on request-log
rows (`user_id`, `session_id` in `GET /admin/logs`). Nothing is inferred: a
request that states no identity records none.

`X-User-ID`, `X-Session-ID` and the `baggage` entries are caller-asserted and
unauthenticated — the gateway does not verify that the caller is who it
claims, so treat them as a label for grouping and attribution, not as an
access-control signal.

| Field | Read from (first non-empty wins) | Recorded as |
|---|---|---|
| end-user id | OpenAI body `user` · `X-User-ID` header · `baggage` entry `user.id` | `enduser.id`, `user_id` |
| session id | `X-Session-ID` header · `baggage` entry `session.id` | `session.id`, `session_id` |
| metadata | embedders only, via `observability.ContextWithRequestIdentity` | `ferro.request.metadata.<key>` |

Request metadata is set by embedders through `ContextWithRequestIdentity`; the
HTTP layer reads no metadata header or body field in this release.
`X-Gateway-Metadata` is a separate, existing header read only by conditional
routing (see [Attribution headers](../AGENTS.md#attribution-headers)); it is not
trace metadata and does not populate `RequestIdentity`.

A header value longer than 256 bytes, or carrying a control character, is
ignored. Unknown JSON body fields are still accepted and ignored, as OpenAI
clients expect; `session_id` and `metadata` are not body fields on this surface.

Embedders set the identity on the request context. An exporter reads it from
the `Event` it is handed, not from its `Export` context: events are delivered
asynchronously by a background worker, so that context is not the request's and
carries no identity — `RequestIdentityFromContext` on it returns the zero value
for every request.

```go
ctx = observability.ContextWithRequestIdentity(ctx, observability.RequestIdentity{
    User:      "user-42",
    SessionID: "sess-7",
    Metadata:  map[string]string{"team": "search"},
})
resp, err := gw.Route(ctx, req)

// …and in an Exporter:
func (e *myExporter) Export(ctx context.Context, evt observability.Event) error {
    user, session, metadata := evt.User, evt.SessionID, evt.Metadata
    // …
}
```

Identity is never forwarded to a provider by the gateway beyond what the
caller's own request already carried (the OpenAI `user` field). Baggage is not
propagated upstream.

## Privacy levels

`privacy_level` controls how error messages are recorded on spans. No prompt or
response content is exported at any level.

| Level | Error recording on spans |
|---|---|
| `none` | Only the static string `redacted` — no message or type |
| `metadata` (default) | Message redacted (email / JWT / AWS keys tokenised) before recording |
| `full` | Raw error text, for trusted self-hosted debugging |

## Exporter plugins

`observability.exporters` wires plugin exporters that receive
`gateway.request.completed` and `gateway.request.failed` events, independently of
whether an OTLP endpoint is set. Implement `observability.Exporter` and register a
factory with `observability.RegisterExporter` in `init()`. No built-in exporters
ship in this repo — they live in the `ai-gateway-plugins` repository. An
unrecognised or failing exporter is warned and skipped; the gateway still starts.
An `Export` that returns an error is logged at error level with the exporter's
name — the first failure and every 64th after it — so a backend refusing every
event shows up in the gateway's log rather than as an integration with no
traffic.
