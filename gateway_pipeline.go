// The routed request pipeline.
//
// Every surface the gateway routes — chat, streaming chat, embeddings, image
// generation — is the same walk: the strategy names an ordered list of
// candidate targets, and the gateway calls them until one answers. Each attempt
// runs under that target's retry policy, its circuit breaker and its
// concurrency limit, and the walk stops at the first candidate unless the
// strategy is one that falls back.
//
// Only two things genuinely differ between surfaces, and they are the only two
// things a caller supplies: which capability a target must have to be a
// candidate, and what the call gives back. Everything else — ordering, retry,
// breaker, limiter, "nothing here can serve this", which target to blame —
// lives here once.
//
// The walk itself is one ordinary function, not a generic one. The type
// parameters exist only on the leaf call, so a request and a response can cross
// the boundary without being boxed into `any` — boxing a Request would allocate
// on every call, and a type parameter is not otherwise faster than an interface
// (go.dev/blog/when-generics). That is the same split every comparable proxy
// made: LiteLLM's router hands one reliability wrapper an `original_function`
// per surface; Portkey's tryTargetsRecursively takes the surface as a value.
//
// Ownership follows Envoy's. Its route table decides where a request may go and
// its cluster decides which endpoint answers, but the RETRY POLICY hangs off the
// route and the CIRCUIT BREAKER off the cluster — neither belongs to the
// load-balancing policy. So here a strategy decides ORDER and nothing else: a
// strategy that picks differently does not get to retry differently. See
// internal/strategies.Strategy.
//
// Plugin stages stay OUTSIDE this walk, and that placement is the point. Envoy
// runs its downstream filter chain once and its upstream chain per retry
// attempt; a budget or guardrail that ran inside the retry loop would bill a
// request three times for one call.
//
// It is deliberately NOT the whole request either. Outcome recording stays with
// the surface, because "the request finished" does not mean the same thing on
// all four: a unary call knows its outcome when it returns, a stream does not
// know it until the channel drains. A hook shaped like a unary return can never
// observe what happens after it returns — the constraint that keeps gRPC-go's
// stream interceptors wrapping a ClientStream rather than post-processing a
// result. The pipeline is the part that IS the same: everything up to and
// including the call that either starts or fails.

// targetPlan is the strategy's decision for one request, resolved once before
// any provider is called.

	// routing would do. A model listing must NOT move with breaker state — a
	// model that vanished while a breaker was open reads to a client as "this

	// counted their setup. The surface takes them as provider wrappers, which
	// hold the slot for the whole stream and leave the breaker outcome to
	// whatever observes the end of it.

// not to call — and then answer 503 while a healthy sibling sat unused. Ranking
// modes were worst: a failed call records no latency sample (see routeTargets),
// so a target that was fastest and then died keeps its low p50, stays ranked
// first, and fails every request. Excluding it is what fixes that; a failure
// PENALTY would not, because a dead target fails fast — connection refused in
// about a millisecond — so its measured duration ranks it first, and a single
// sample cannot move a p50 taken over a 100-sample window anyway.
//
// This is deliberately the same rule Readiness applies (gateway_health.go): a
// target is routable when its circuit is not open, and a target with NO breaker
// configured is healthy, because "would a call be admitted" is the question and
// for that target the answer is yes. Reading state is non-consuming — it never
// admits or spends a half-open probe — and a HALF-OPEN target stays eligible,
// which is what lets a recovering target earn its probe through normal traffic.
//
// It filters, it does not refuse: when every candidate is open the UNFILTERED
// list is returned. That fail-open is load-bearing in two directions.
//
// Returning an empty list instead would make routeTargets attempt nothing, and
// "nothing was attempted" is errNoCapableTarget — a 404 model_not_found. "No
// target serves this model" and "every target that serves it is down" are
// different answers, and only the first is the caller's to fix. Handing the
// unfiltered list back instead lets the walk attempt a target, the breaker
// refuse it with circuitbreaker.ErrCircuitOpen, and apierror classify that as
// the 503 it already classifies it as. Every comparable system answers 503 here
// — Envoy's "no healthy upstream", HAProxy, Kong, ingress-nginx, gRPC's
// UNAVAILABLE — and none answers 404. 429 would be wrong for a different
// reason: it tells a caller at 1 rps that THEY are being throttled, and sends
// them hunting for their own rate limit while the upstream is down.
//
// It also keeps an operator's explicit routing decision from being overridden.
// Under `conditional` or `content-based` a matched rule names a target on
// purpose; the filter makes that target preferred-but-not-exclusive rather than
// ignored, and when nothing else is healthy the rule still gets its way.
//
// Circuit state is one thing the strategy genuinely cannot know — the same

// therefore comes first, and the refusal still runs the on_error stage, so a

// The trade is deliberate: a deployment that runs a transform gives up the

// A POOL mode picks its head from targets the operator declared
// interchangeable, for a reason that is about the pool rather than about that
// target: spread the load, take the cheapest, take the fastest, split the
// traffic. The request belongs to the pool, so when the head is dead, carrying
// it to a sibling is what the operator asked for. Answering 503 with a healthy
// target holding the same model is the one outcome none of these modes was
// configured to produce.
//
// A NAMED mode picks its head because something said that target specifically —
// `single` names it, and a `conditional` or `content-based` rule matched it.
// Serving from somebody else would demote the rule to a suggestion, so these
// stop at the head and report the failure.
//
// Only `fallback` advanced before, which read as though advancing were a
// fallback-shaped feature. It is not: it is the pool's own semantics. Without
// it a dead target with no circuit breaker — the shipped default, and 29 of the
// 30 targets in the example configs — absorbed its whole selection share and
// failed it. Under `cost-optimized`, which ranks deterministically, that was
// every single request.
//
// A breaker remains worth configuring, and does a different job: it stops the
// walk from paying the dead target's connection timeout on every request. It is
// what makes failover CHEAP; this is what makes it HAPPEN.
//
// A rule mode (`conditional`, `content-based`) sits between the two: its
// strategy returns exactly the matched rule's target chain — a one-entry chain
// for `target_key` — and nothing outside it, so the walk advances within the
// chain under the same failover-safe classes a pool uses and can never reach
// a target the rule did not name. Exactness comes from the candidate list
// being the chain, not from refusing to advance.

//
//	func embeddingProvider(p providers.Provider) bool {
//		_, ok := providers.As[providers.EmbeddingProvider](p)
//		return ok
//	}
//	func embed(ctx context.Context, p providers.Provider, req providers.EmbeddingRequest) (*providers.EmbeddingResponse, error) {
//		provider, _ := providers.As[providers.EmbeddingProvider](p)
//		return provider.Embed(ctx, req)
//	}
//
// then routeTargets(ctx, g, g.planFor(req.Model, keys), req, embeddingProvider, embed).
// The gate has already run when the leaf call executes, so its assertion cannot
// fail. That replaces routeEmbedding/routeImage and routeSurfaceTarget outright,
// and the surfaces inherit the four fixes here — uniform retry, a real provider
// label, a duration observation on failures, and 503/504 classification — without
// writing any of them.
//
// The payload type is why SkipProvider cannot serve these surfaces and why the
// request logger never records them: plugin.Context.Response is the chat-shaped
// providers.Response with no field able to hold an EmbeddingResponse. That is a
// PLUGIN CONTRACT question, not a pipeline one — the pipeline is already
// payload-agnostic — so it is settled in runSurfaceGovernance, which stays where
// it is, outside the walk, exactly like chat's plugin stages.
//
// STREAMING attaches at the same seam but must not pretend to be unary. Its
// leaf call returns a channel whose lifetime outlives the attempt, so:
//
//   - Resp is <-chan providers.StreamChunk, and the leaf call is
//     raceCompleteStream(attemptCtx, streamCtx, …) — the wait is bounded, the
//     call is not. Two contexts, one of them captured by the closure that
//     builds the leaf call, because only the start phase may be deadlined.
//   - The gate is the providers.StreamProvider assertion.
//   - The circuit breaker must NOT resolve when the call returns: a stream that
//     started is not yet a success. Streaming therefore passes cb == nil to the
//     pipeline, and its leaf call takes the breaker admission itself
//     (startStreamAttempt): every failed start — an abandoned wait included —
//     is resolved there, once, and a started stream's admission is resolved
//     through streamwrap's CircuitBreakerOutcome when the stream ends.
//     Anything else strands the half-open probe and wedges the target for good.
//   - Success recording stays in streamwrap; only the START failure path is the
//     pipeline's, which is the half that is genuinely unary-shaped.
//
// That asymmetry is not a wart to design away. It is why gRPC-go's stream
// interceptors wrap a ClientStream instead of post-processing a result: a hook
// shaped like a unary return cannot observe a terminal status that arrives
// later.
