import "context"

// ServerConfig defines how the gateway connects to one external MCP server.
// It lives in gateway.Config.MCPServers and is consumed by the internal Registry.
//
// Transport selection: when Command is non-empty the gateway uses stdio transport
// (the server is launched as a subprocess). Otherwise Streamable HTTP transport
// is used and URL must be provided.
type ServerConfig struct {
	// Name is a unique human-readable identifier for this MCP server.
	Name string `json:"name" yaml:"name"`

	// ── HTTP transport (URL must be set when Command is empty) ───────────────
	// URL is the Streamable HTTP endpoint (e.g. "https://mcp.example.com/mcp").
	URL string `json:"url,omitempty" yaml:"url,omitempty"`
	// Headers are additional HTTP headers sent with every MCP request
	// (e.g. authorization tokens). Values may reference environment variables
	// using ${VAR} — only the braced form is a reference, a bare $ is literal
	// data, and an undefined variable is an error rather than a blank secret.
	// References are resolved when the MCP client is constructed, not when the
	// config is loaded, so the Config itself never carries a materialised secret
	// into the config-history store or GET /admin/config.
	//
	// Ignored for stdio servers (those setting Command).
	Headers map[string]string `json:"headers,omitempty" yaml:"headers,omitempty"`

	// ── Stdio transport (Command must be set; URL/Headers are ignored) ───────
	// Command is the executable to launch as an MCP stdio server.
	// The process is started at gateway-init time and kept alive for the
	// lifetime of the gateway.
	Command string `json:"command,omitempty" yaml:"command,omitempty"`
	// Args are the command-line arguments passed to Command.
	Args []string `json:"args,omitempty" yaml:"args,omitempty"`
	// Env are the environment variables injected into the subprocess.
	//
	// The subprocess does NOT inherit the gateway's environment. It receives a
	// minimal base — PATH, HOME, LANG and TMPDIR, when set — plus exactly the
	// keys listed here, which override the base. So no gateway credential such
	// as OPENAI_API_KEY or MASTER_KEY reaches an MCP server implicitly.
	//
	// This is isolation from *implicit* inheritance, not a prohibition: a value
	// placed here deliberately — including a credential, including one drawn
	// from the gateway's own environment via ${VAR} — is passed through as
	// configured. Treat this map as the trust boundary and populate it
	// knowingly.
	//
	// A consequence worth knowing: servers that need other inherited variables
	// (HTTPS_PROXY, NODE_PATH, SSL_CERT_FILE, or SYSTEMROOT and APPDATA on
	// Windows) must have them listed here explicitly.
	//
	// Values may reference environment variables using ${VAR} — only the braced
	// form, same rules as Headers — resolved when the MCP client is constructed.
	// Since the gateway's own environment is not inherited, this is the only
	// channel by which a credential can reach an MCP subprocess.
	Env map[string]string `json:"env,omitempty" yaml:"env,omitempty"`

	// ── Common options ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	// AllowedTools restricts which tools from this server are exposed to the LLM.
	// An empty slice means all discovered tools are allowed.
	AllowedTools []string `json:"allowed_tools,omitempty" yaml:"allowed_tools,omitempty"`
	// MaxCallDepth limits the agentic tool-calling depth for this server.
	// The minimum positive value across all registered servers is used;
	// servers with MaxCallDepth ≤ 0 are excluded from the minimum.
	// Defaults to 5 when all servers leave MaxCallDepth unset or zero.
	MaxCallDepth int `json:"max_call_depth,omitempty" yaml:"max_call_depth,omitempty"`
	// TimeoutSeconds is the per-request timeout for individual tool calls to
	// this server. Applies to both HTTP and stdio transports. Defaults to 30
	// when unset or zero.
	TimeoutSeconds int `json:"timeout_seconds,omitempty" yaml:"timeout_seconds,omitempty"`
	// Required makes this server's availability a condition of gateway
	// readiness. When true and the server is not ready, GET /readyz answers 503
	// and an orchestrator takes the instance out of rotation.
	//
	// A server is unready when it never completed the initialize handshake,
	// which includes one whose transport could not be built at all. Death after
	// a successful handshake is detected for stdio servers only: an HTTP server
	// that becomes unreachable keeps reporting ready and keeps its tools
	// advertised, so Required cannot be relied on to withdraw an instance when
	// one goes down.
	//
	// Defaults to false: an unset or absent Required never affects /readyz, so
	// upgrading does not change readiness behaviour for any existing config.
	// Opt in per server, and only for a server whose tools the deployment
	// genuinely cannot serve without — a required server that is down stops all
	// traffic through this instance, including requests that use no tools at
	// all. Every server's state appears in the /readyz body either way, so
	// operators can observe MCP health without gating on it.
	Required bool `json:"required,omitempty" yaml:"required,omitempty"`

// invocation. It is passed to [ToolCallAuditFn] on every tool call.

// invocation (success or failure). Implementations must be non-blocking;
// delegate any I/O to a goroutine.
//
// The ctx carries the Route call's values — callers may embed per-request
// values (e.g. trace ID, API key ID) for retrieval inside the hook — but not its
// cancellation: the hook runs after the call, often after the request has ended.
