// ErrPassthroughUninspectable is the refusal a pass-through request gets when a
// content guardrail is configured and the request body cannot be projected into
// anything that guardrail could read — a multipart upload, an audio payload, a
// body past the projection cap, or one that is not JSON at all.
//
// It is a REFUSAL rather than a silent pass because a guardrail that cannot see
// a body has not approved it. Failing open here is what made the pass-through a
// hole: the six natively-handled endpoints screened their prompts and every
// other /v1/ path forwarded whatever it was given, under the gateway's own
// provider credential. The same rule is Envoy's ext_authz — whose 413 on an
// oversized body explicitly overrides failure_mode_allow — and OPA's, which
// returns a denial rather than an error precisely so a fail-open cannot rescue
// it.
//
// It is a plugin.RejectionError because that is what it IS — a policy denial
// made before the request reached a provider, whose reason is written to be read
// by the caller — and because being one gives it the treatment a denial should
// get everywhere downstream without a second vocabulary: 400 with its reason
// intact from internal/apierror, and counted as a rejection rather than an error
// by the metrics (see recordPluginAbort), so a deployment refusing binary
// uploads does not read as a provider outage.
//
// It is the one such error the plugin manager does not mint. Plugin names it as
// the gateway rather than as a plugin, because no plugin made this call: the
// deployment's guardrail policy did, in the one place a guardrail could not be
// asked.

// RoutePassthrough runs the gateway request lifecycle around one /v1/*
// pass-through forward, so a forwarded endpoint is governed by the same rules a
// natively-handled one is.
//
// It exists because there must not be two classes of /v1/ route. The wildcard
// pass-through is worth keeping — OpenAI's API is far larger than the endpoints
// served natively, and /v1/fine_tuning, /v1/images/edits, /v1/vector_stores and
// /v1/realtime are forwarded rather than each being reimplemented — but a route
// that skips admission,
// plugins, the circuit breaker, the concurrency limit and the request log is a
// route with different governance, and the endpoint a caller picks then decides
// which policy applies to them.
//
// target is the virtual key of the target that will receive the forward; the
// caller has already resolved it and checked it against the targets allowlist.
// model is the model the body named, empty when it named none — most of the
// endpoints this surface exists for carry no model at all.
//
// body is a best-effort text projection of the request body, and
// bodyInspectable reports whether that projection is faithful. When it is
// false and a before_request guardrail is configured, the request is refused
// with ErrPassthroughUninspectable before any plugin runs and before anything
// is forwarded. See projectBody in internal/proxy for what a projection covers.
//
// forward performs the actual HTTP forward and reports whether it succeeded. It
// writes the upstream response straight to the client, which bounds what the
// stages after it can do — see below.
//
// What applies, and what deliberately does not:
//
//   - before_request, after_request and on_error plugins: yes, with
//     Metadata["surface"] = "passthrough" so a plugin can branch on it.
//   - circuit breaker and per-target concurrency: yes, via the same
//     callUnderResilience the routed pipeline uses.
//   - request log and cost accounting: yes. Cost is recorded as UNPRICED, never
//     as a known zero: the response is opaque by construction, and buffering an
//     arbitrarily large, possibly streaming, possibly binary body to hunt for a
//     usage object would break the very endpoints this surface exists for.
//     unpriced is the honest answer; parse usage per-endpoint only if
//     pass-through billing is ever actually needed.
//   - retry: NO, deliberately, and excluded here rather than by omission. The
//     request body has already been streamed upstream by the time a failure is
//     known, so there is nothing left to replay, and the endpoints behind this
//     surface are not idempotent — a retried /v1/files upload is a second file
//     and a retried /v1/batches submission is a second batch.
//   - admission (admitModel): NO. The caller resolved the provider itself, from
//     the X-Provider header or from the routing index, and gated it on target
//     membership. Re-asking "does any target serve this model" would refuse
//     every model-less endpoint and would close the documented X-Provider
//     escape hatch for a model no index can enumerate.
//
// Known ceiling: forward writes the upstream response to the client as it
// arrives, so an after_request plugin that REJECTS cannot unsend those bytes.
// The stage still runs and its verdict is still recorded and returned, which is
// what puts the request in the log; it just cannot retract a delivered
// response. Streaming chat has the same ceiling for the same reason. Screening
// what a caller SENDS is before_request's job, and that stage runs with nothing
// yet written.
